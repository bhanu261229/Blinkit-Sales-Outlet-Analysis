# 🛒 Blinkit Sales outlet Analysis (Python Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on Blinkit sales data using **Python**.  
The goal is to analyze sales performance, customer preferences, and outlet-wise trends using **KPIs and visualizations**.
Using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project evaluates sales trends across item fat content, item types, outlet size, outlet location, and establishment year.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualization

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **File Name:** `blinkit_Data.csv`
- **Source:** Blinkit sales dataset
- **Key Columns:**
  - Item Fat Content
  - Item Type
  - Sales
  - Rating
  - Outlet Size
  - Outlet Location Type
  - Outlet Establishment Year

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Standardized `Item Fat Content` values:
  - `low fat`, `LF` → **Low Fat**
  - `reg` → **Regular**
- Verified data types and dataset shape
- Checked unique values and missing data

---

## 📊 Business KPIs
The following KPIs were calculated:

- **Total Sales**

### 3️⃣ Fat Content by Outlet Location (Total Sales)
- Grouped bar chart comparing **Regular vs Low Fat** across outlet tiers

### 4️⃣ Total Sales by Outlet Establishment Year
- Line chart showing sales trend over establishment years

### 5️⃣ Sales by Outlet Size
